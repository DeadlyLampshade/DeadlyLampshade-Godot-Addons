# DeadlyLampshade's Godot Addons

## Introduction

This is a list of the variety of utility scripts I've created for my purposes that I hope you will find useful.

## Plugin List

- **ProbeGen** - A plugin I created to take the work out of placing GI Probes and BakedLightmaps in a scene, so I could focus more on placing assets than probes.
- **Tag Editor** - This allows you to replace the standard string array property editor with a cool tag editor.
